1. Why there is NO concept of pointers in Java

Java does not support pointers like C/C++ because of security, simplicity, and reliability.

Main Reasons:

1.Security :

Pointers can access any memory location.

This may lead to unauthorized memory access.

Java avoids this to prevent hacking and memory corruption.

2.No direct memory manipulation :

Java uses references, not pointers.

JVM manages memory automatically using Garbage Collection.

3.Platform Independence :

Pointer size depends on system architecture.

Java avoids pointers to remain Write Once, Run Anywhere.

Avoids errors like

Dangling pointers

Memory leaks

Buffer overflow
